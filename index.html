        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Currently living in Uganda, aspiring to be a full fledged digital master when it comes to marketing and design. I've been able to travel to many different countries during my olympic swimming career, experiencing different cultures and ways of life. 
 
<p>My main aspiration in life is to bring all that i've been able to learn from diverse cultures and hopefully incorporate it into my my life and work bringing various ideas and synergy that would shift minds and create possiblities never even thought of.</p>

      <div class="card">
